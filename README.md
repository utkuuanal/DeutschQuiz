I made a Deutsch word quiz program with python

with this program you can test your knowledge for German words

use addorchange.py to add or change german words for the quiz.

use  removewords.py to remove words from the quiz.

use deutschquiz.py to take the quiz. 

text.txt is your german dictionary for the quiz.

there is 3 example word in the dictionary.

since i am trying to learn german also, it would be great if you share your dictionaries with me so i can upload them.

I know there is a lot to improve, feel free to share your code suggestions with me.
