I made a Deutsch word quiz program with python

with this program you can test your knowledge for German words

use addorchange.py to add or change german words for the quiz
use  removewords.py to remove words from the quiz
use deutschquiz.py to take the quiz 
text.txt is your german dictionary for the quiz 
there is 3 example word in the dictionary

since i am trying to learn german also, it would be great if you share your dictionaries with me
